This is a simple Calculator program designed using the Python Tkinter framework. 

5/29/2024 - This simple calculator has buttons 0 - 9 for the user to click on and supports an add, clear and equal button as "Special" functions. 

P.s. i'm very excited to reach this milestone and this is essentially my first functioning program that i've commited to Github. 

Future iterations will include multiplication, divide, power, etc.
